#We see a spike for young boys peaking at age 3, and then an increase
#(particularly for women) starting around middle age, and a gradual decline
#after age 80. I suspect the peak is because boys usually use the toilet
#standing up, and the increase for women is due to osteoporosis (i.e., I
#suspect women and men have injuries at the same rate, but more women
# end up in the ER because they are at higher risk of fractures).
#One problem with interpreting this pattern is that we know that there are
#fewer older people than younger people, so the population available to be
# injured is smaller. We can control for this by comparing the number of
# people injured with the total population and calculating an injury rate. Here
#I use a rate per 10,000:

summary <- selected %>%
  count(age, sex, wt = weight) %>%

  mutate(rate = n / population * 1e4)

#  Plotting the rate, as shown, yields a strikingly different trend
# after age 50: the difference between men and women is much smaller, and
# we no longer see a decrease. This is because women tend to live longer than
# men, so at older ages there are simply more women alive to be injured by
# toilets:
