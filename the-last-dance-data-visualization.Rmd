- First plot shows us, Bad Boys (Detroit Pistons) has damaged a lot MJ's career. He lost 43 matches against Detroit Pistons in his entire career, but also he won 43 matches likewise against them. Also, Utah Jazz both has lost and won 19 matches against playing him.

- While MJ was playing for Washington Wizards, he won 5 matches and lost 1 match against his former team. Even Chicago Bulls couldn't stop Jordan.

- New York Knicks was defeated many many times by Michael Jordan. I believe that NYK players didn't want to play against him. There are other teams that lose many times like NYK such as Atlanta Hawks, Cleveland Cavaliers, Milwaukee Bucks etc.

- He has not win ever against Boston Celtics in the Playoffs at 1986 and 1987 seasons. 

- Also New York Knicks was one of the best teams in 90's. NYK was the team that MJ has stood and won the most in the Playoffs. Even NYK was not defeated Chicago Bulls, Detroit Pistons was defeated them three years in a row between 1989-1990 seasons in the Championship.

# **Jordan Rules Vol:2** {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

- Next step, I would like to see the difference between the number of matches won and lost. Many teams could not resist MJ.

- He has played against 33 teams in the NBA. Was he winner or loser?

- There are a few teams had negative score that the difference between the frequency of a win and a loss in his entire career.

- There are two teams that equals when we compare winning and losing scores: Detroit Pistons and Utah Jazz. MJ has played 124 matches in total and he won half of the matches against them.

- In this section, we are going to look at the percentage of the matches that he won and lost.

- First output gives us the percentage of the matches he played. Other statistics we calculated shows us the difference between the number of matches won and lost according to his whole career, regular seasons and playoffs.

- When all of the matches MJ's played investigated, MJ has won 64%!
