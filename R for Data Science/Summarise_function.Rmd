## Summarise function

```{r}
library(nycflights13)
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r}
summarise(flights, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## GROUP BY

```{r}
by_day = group_by(flights, year, month)
summarise(by_day, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```


## using the pipe

Exploring the relationship between the dis
tance and average delay for each location.

```{r}
delays <- flights %>%
  group_by(dest) %>% 
  summarise(count = n(),
            dist = mean(distance, na.rm = TRUE),
            delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%         
  filter(count > 20, dest != 'HNL')
```


```{r}
ggplot(data = delays, mapping = aes(x = dist, y = delay)) +    
  geom_point(aes(size = count), alpha = 1/3) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE)
```
