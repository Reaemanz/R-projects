If you get stuck you can check out [this notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/hints-for-exploratory-data-visualization-exercises/). It has hints that you can expand to show you what your output visualization should look like and, if you’re completely lost, the code to generate those figures. You can also use the notebook to check your work once you're finished. \n\n\n## Table of contents:\n___\n1.  [Setting up our notebook environment](#Setting-up-our-notebook-environment)\n2.

If you're curious, you can learn more about what this means in [this paper](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.html).\n\nPlots in ggplot2 are \"built up\" using multiple functions connected with the plus sign (+). The first function, ggplot(), just draws the outline of the plot, including the the axes and tick marks. It takes two arguments:\n\n1. The dataset that you want to plot. \n2. A function, aes(), short for aesthetic. This function can take multiple arguments, and each argument tells ggplot which variables in the dataset you want to be mapped to which part of the plot. By default, the first two arguments will be assigned to the x-axis and y-axis.\n\nThe ggplot() function itself doesn't actually plot anything, it just creates the outline of the plot. To actually plot something in that outline, we need to add a geom layer to our plot. There are lots of different geom layers (you can see a full list of them [here](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/#section-layer-geoms)) and you can add multiple layers to the same plot. The general syntax of ggplot looks like this:\n\n    # ggplot syntax looks like this\n    ggplot(dataset, aes(x = xaxis, y = yaxis)) +\n        geom_something() +\n        geom_somethingElse()\n\nFirst you call ggplot() and pass it the dataset & aesthetics you want to plot. Then you add the layer(s) you want. \n\nNote that you do need to have a plus sign between every layer of the same plot. If you end a line without a plus sign, ggplot2 will think that you're done adding things and ignore everything that shows up after that (you'll also get an error because R doesn't expect lines to begin with +).\n\n    # This will just plot the empty ggplot, without the geom_something\n    ggplot(dataset, aes(x = xaxis, y = yaxis))\n        + geom_something()"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"ca84bb01d4ff08d67372aeaa034ade47ba4292dc","_cell_guid":"02a59a66-0ea6-422f-a0d8-8d902ed93f2e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Univariate Data\n___\n\nYou can use these visualizations when you want to look at one variable at a time.

This is known as *parsing* a date.\n\n> **What does the mdy() function do?** This tells R that the date is in the format month, day, year. In order to a parse a date you'll need to specify the order of the parts of the date. Some other similar functions include:\n\n> * **ymd()**, for dates that are year, month and then day\n> *  **dmy()**, for dates that are day, month and then year\n> * **ymd_hms()**, for dates that are year, month, day, hour, minute and finally second\n\n> Once a date is parsed, you can easily extract parts of it using functions like month() and year(). You can learn more about parsing dates [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lubridate/vignettes/lubridate.html).\n\nIn this example, we've done a tiny bit of extra data processing to remove the day of the week (Sunday, Monday, etc.) that's been included in the date.
